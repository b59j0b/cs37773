Describe the performance of each user including the troubles they faced – what they did wrong and what they did right. Record also a brief persona of each user you have chosen. The persona needs to cover significant details of the user.
When you ask the users to perform. the task – describe only the goal and not the steps. Let the user figure out the steps while you note their actions.
